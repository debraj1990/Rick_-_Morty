This a basic application which renders the Characters from the "Rick and Morty" TV show. User can perform search, filter and sorting here. Its created for Mobile,tablet and Desktop devices . 
Tech Stack used :
•	React JS
•	GraphQL
•	Redux
•	Libraries 
    o	Bootstrap
    o	React-js-pagination
    o	CSS Modules
    o	Jest and Enzyme for testing
    o	Moment.js

Limitations: 
In case of filtering, as the API provided only name, status, species, type and gender fields , so only on these user can filter and that also, only one subcategory per search, 
For example, user can search for either species (alien) or species (human) but not both at the same time.
